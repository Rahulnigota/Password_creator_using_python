# Password_creator_using_python
You can create a simple password generator in Python using the random module. Here's an example of a basic password generator that creates a random password of a specified length:

In this code:

1.We import the random and string modules, which are used for generating random characters and working with strings.
2.The generate_password function takes a length parameter and generates a random password of the specified length.
3.We define the set of characters to choose from for the password. In this example, we include lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters.
4.The random.choice() function is used to select random characters from the character set, and these characters are joined together to form the password.
You can adjust the length parameter to generate passwords of different lengths according to your requirements.
